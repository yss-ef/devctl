# Devctl

`devctl` is a professional command-line interface (CLI) designed to automate and
orchestrate the development lifecycle for modern full-stack architectures. It
provides a unified workflow for managing backends (Spring Boot, NestJS, Go,
FastAPI), frontends (Angular, Vue, React, NextJS, Svelte), and their
containerization.

## Core Features

-   **Multi-Stack Orchestration**: Launch databases, multiple microservices, and
    frontend dev servers with a single command. Includes real-time, prefixed log
    streaming.
-   **Full-Stack Scaffolding**: Generate consistent business resources
    (Entities, DTOs, Controllers, Services) across both backend and frontend
    layers simultaneously.
-   **Instant Infrastructure**: Automatically generate optimized, multi-stage
    `Dockerfiles` and global `docker-compose.yml` configurations by scanning
    your project tree.
-   **Security by Default**: Inject standardized JWT authentication and security
    configurations into new projects.

## Installation

You can install `devctl` locally for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yss-ef/devctl.git
cd devctl
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a Full-Stack Project

Create a new backend and frontend in seconds:

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
devctl init spring api --db postgres
devctl init angular front
```

### 2. Add a Business Resource

Generate a complete vertical slice of your application:

```bash
devctl add resource Product -f "name:string,price:double,quantity:int"
```

### 3. Run the Environment

Launch everything in parallel with automatic database startup:

```bash
devctl run
```
